# 🧾 Policy Compliance Gap Analysis – Risk Visualization Dashboard

## 📘 Description
This project is a **Policy Compliance Gap Analysis Tool** designed to help organizations identify, assess, and track compliance gaps against frameworks like **SOC 2** and **ISO 27001**.

The sheet automatically organizes data across **10 control domains** — including password policy, data backup, incident response, and more — and uses **donut charts** to visualize the distribution of risk levels (**High**, **Medium**, **Low**) for quick decision-making.
